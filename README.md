# Appian Data Services – Landing Page

A minimal, fast landing page you can publish with GitHub Pages and point your domain at.

## Quick start

1. Create a repository (public is fine) and upload these files to the repository root.
2. In the repo, go to Settings → Pages and set:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` / `/ (root)`
3. In the same Pages screen, set Custom domain to `appiandataservices.com` and Save (this writes a `CNAME` file).
4. Point your DNS at GitHub Pages (see notes in the main instructions).

You can replace the email address in `index.html` later.
